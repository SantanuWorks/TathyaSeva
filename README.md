# TathyaSeva

TathyaSeva is a multi-langual data handling desktop application. Basically, the idea is to combine the functionalities of a DBMS ( Database Management System ) and Data Science tool. The integrated tool can perform data science operations on a table which is structured and unstuctured data can be processed and store in a database. Apart from these technical functionalities there is language solution to it. This application is language independen, which simply means that user can use his preferred language to perform taks. Initially it has only languages i.e. English and Odia. Latter on languages can added as a package.

2. Data visualisation like pie charts, graphs etc.
3. DBMS functionalites like table creation, datastore creation etc.
